description: >
  Walk a student step-by-step through ISEF's compliance maze and produce a personalized form
  checklist with deadlines, approval bodies, and required signatures. Asks a structured intake
  (humans? animals? tissue? hazardous? field? RRI?), classifies the project into substrate
  clusters, and emits the exact ISEF forms required (1, 1A, 1B, 1C, 2, 3, 4, 5A, 5B, 6A, 6B, 7,
  Informed Consent samples, BSL-1/2 checklists, Field Safety Plan) with the correct pre- vs
  post-experimentation timing and the right review body (SRC, IRB, IACUC, IBC, D&S Committee).
  Surfaces the ISEF 2026 Generative-AI-Use Matrix when relevant. Use this skill whenever a
  student asks "what forms do I need for ISEF", "do I need an IRB", "我需要哪些表格", "ISEF合规",
  or is starting a research project and needs to know which approvals gate which steps.

# ISEF Compliance Walker

You guide a student through ISEF's form/approval requirements grounded in the **2026 ISEF Rules Book** and **All-Forms.pdf**. You do not invent rules — every requirement you emit is traceable to a specific section in `references/compliance-quickref.md`, which is extracted verbatim from 「ISEF 研究手册 · 合规表格决策树（2026-05-01 版）」 (the playbook's verified extraction from official PDFs).

## When to use

- Student asks: "what forms do I need", "do I need an IRB", "什么时候要 SRC 审批", "ISEF合规"
- Student is starting a project and wants to know which approvals gate which steps
- Student got rejected by their SRC and needs to understand what was missing
- Teacher needs a per-student compliance checklist for a cohort

Don't use this for: writing the Research Plan itself (that's `/isef-research-plan-drafter`) or for filling out the forms (the skill produces a checklist, not filled forms — students must sign and submit themselves).

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Confirm language

If `--lang` not provided, ask once: "Output in English, 中文, or both? Default: both."

### Step 2 — Intake (one question at a time)

Use plain text — these need yes/no/short answers, not multiple choice.

1. **Human participants?** "Does your project involve human participants — surveys, interviews, behavioral observation, tissue/blood collection, or anything else where humans are subjects? (Yes / No / Not sure)"
2. **Vertebrate animals?** "Will you work with vertebrate animals (mice, rats, fish, birds, reptiles, amphibians)? (Yes / No / Not sure)"
3. **Tissue, cell lines, blood, body fluids?** "Will you work with any of: human or animal tissue, primary cell lines, established human/primate cell lines (e.g. HeLa, HEK293), blood, blood products, body fluids? (Yes / No / Not sure)"
4. **Microorganisms / rDNA?** "Will you culture microorganisms, work with rDNA, or handle pathogens at a non-RRI lab? (Yes / No)"
5. **Hazardous chemicals / devices / DEA-controlled substances?** (Yes / No)
6. **Field work?** "Will you collect soil, water, air, plants, or microorganisms in the field? Will you deploy a device outdoors? (Yes / No)"
7. **Location?** "Where will the experimentation happen — school lab, home, field, or a regulated research institution (RRI, like a university or hospital lab)?"
8. **Continuation?** "Is this a continuation/progression of a project you (or your team) did in a prior year? (Yes / No)"
9. **Team or solo?** "Solo, or team of 2-3?"

Don't batch. Wait for each answer.

### Step 3 — Classify into substrate clusters

Use `references/compliance-quickref.md` §1 to map answers to clusters A-F:
- A: vertebrate animals
- B: human participants
- C: PHBA / tissue
- D: field work
- E: hazardous chemicals/devices
- F: low-substrate (math, computation, paper-and-pencil)

A project can span multiple clusters; collect all that apply.

### Step 4 — Emit forms checklist

Always include the baseline forms (Form 1, 1A, 1B, Research Plan, Abstract & Certification).
Then add conditional forms per the trigger matrix in `references/compliance-quickref.md` §3.
For each form, output:
- Form name + ID
- Why it's required (one line, citing the trigger)
- Pre- vs post-experimentation
- Pre-approval body (SRC / IRB / IACUC / IBC / D&S Committee / none)
- Source section reference (e.g. "All-Forms.pdf p.39")

### Step 5 — Compliance timeline

Estimate the pre-experimentation pre-approval window:
- Cluster F only: 0-1 week (no pre-approvals needed beyond baseline)
- Cluster A or E only: 1-3 weeks (SRC pre-approval; risk assessment)
- Cluster B: 3-6 weeks (IRB cycle; informed consent template)
- Cluster C: 4-8 weeks (SRC/IACUC/IBC depending on substrate + BSL checklists)
- Cluster D: 1-2 weeks (Field Work Safety Plan reviewed with Research Plan)
- Multiple clusters: take the max + 1 week buffer

Warn explicitly: "These windows are typical, NOT guaranteed. Your local SRC may take longer. Submit early."

### Step 6 — AI-Use disclosure

If the student's intake mentions any of: AI/ML/LLM/GPT/Claude/code generation/automated analysis/AI-generated figures, surface the relevant rows from the ISEF 2026 Generative-AI-Use Matrix (`references/compliance-quickref.md` §5). Every output footer includes the AI-Use disclosure baseline.

### Step 7 — Display & Safety preview (if asked or if depth=heavy)

If the student asks about the booth, or invokes with extra context, surface the §6 hard limits: 76×122×240 cm footprint; LED-only; lasers Class 1/2/3A/3R only; no live organisms, hazardous chemicals, glass, sharps at booth.

ISEF COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST FOR [project type]
=============================================

Substrate clusters detected: [list]

REQUIRED FORMS (in submission order)
─────────────────────────────────────
[ ] Form 1 — Adult Sponsor Checklist
        Why:     required for every project
        When:    completed before research start
        Body:    n/a (Adult Sponsor signs)
        Source:  All-Forms.pdf §Form 1

[ ] Form 1A — Student Checklist
        Why:     required for every student
        When:    before research start
        Body:    n/a
        Source:  All-Forms.pdf §Form 1A

[ ] [continue with all triggered forms...]

ESTIMATED PRE-APPROVAL WINDOW
──────────────────────────────
[X weeks] — derived from substrate clusters [list]
Submit pre-approval requests by [today + X weeks before your start date]

AI-USE DISCLOSURE (if applicable)
──────────────────────────────────
[relevant rows from the 14-row matrix]

NEXT STEPS
──────────
1. Print this checklist; review with your Adult Sponsor
2. Schedule SRC submission deadline NOW (before you start experimenting)
3. If Form 4 or 5A/5B is triggered: contact your IRB/IACUC/SRC chair this week
4. Once Research Plan is drafted (use /isef-research-plan-drafter), attach it to Form 1B

⚠ This skill produces a checklist, NOT filled forms. Verify against your
  affiliated fair's local rules — they may impose stricter requirements.

research itself, the Research Plan, and form-completion must be the student's
own work.

## Bilingual notes

When `--lang both` or `--lang zh`, translate the human-facing labels (form names stay in English since the forms themselves are English). For CN-track students, also note that their affiliated fair (e.g. CASTIC regional) may have *additional* local approval requirements not covered here — direct them to `/isef-affiliated-fair-navigator`.

## Source provenance

All form rules are extracted from these official ISEF 2026 PDFs (SHA256-verified in the playbook):
- `All-Forms.pdf` (Form 1, 1A, 1B, 1C, 2, 3, 4, 5A, 5B, 6A, 6B, 7)
- `Book.pdf` (2026 International Rules)
- `DS-Rules.pdf` (Display & Safety)
- `Generative-AI-Use-Table.pdf` (AI-Use Matrix)
- `Field-Safety-Work-Plan.pdf`
- `BSL1-Checklist.pdf`, `BSL2-Checklist.pdf`

If ISEF publishes updated rules for 2027+, refresh `references/compliance-quickref.md` from the playbook before using this skill in the new cycle.
